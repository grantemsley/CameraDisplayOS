# Set the stream URL with username and password for the RTSP stream you want to view on each camera.
# Use low definition streams if possible to save network bandwidth and processing power.
# It is unlikely to work if you try to display full HD streams - omxplayer does not like scaling down.
# The images are being shown at a resolution of 960x540, so anything close to that is better.
#
# Typical stream URLs:
#
# Bosch: rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:554/?inst=2
# Brillcam: rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:554/live/sub
# AXIS: rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:554/onvif-media/media.amp 
# ANPVIZ: rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:554/stream1 
# Hikvision: rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:554/Streaming/Channels/102

# If you aren't using a position, set it to 'NONE' to show as blank instead of the not configured message.
